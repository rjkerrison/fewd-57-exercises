              Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which
              also includes otters, polecats, weasels and wolverines. They
              belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Badgers are thought to have got their name because of the white
              mark – or badge – on their head, although there are other
              theories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another old name for badgers is ‘brock’, meaning grey. You can
              often see the word brock in street names. Brock is also the name
              of a character in the Pokemon TV series!
            </p>
            <p>
              Badgers are fast – they can run up to 30km per hour (nearly 20
              mph) for short periods.

              Honey badgers can reach 2.4 feet in length and weigh between 19
              and 26 pounds. They have bushy tail that is usually 12 inches
              long.
            </p>
            <p>
              Honey badger has incredible thick skin that cannot be pierced with
              arrows, spears or even machete. Skin is also very loose, which is
              useful in the case of attack. When predator grabs a badger, animal
              rotates in its skin and turns toward predator's face to fight back
              (attacking its eyes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Honey badger has very sharp teeth. They can easily break tortoise
              shell.

              Although badgers are a solitary animal the young Hog Badger tends
              to be quite playful and social. I would be careful playing with
              any animal that has extremely large claws. Remember folks, it is
              all fun and games until someone loses an eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hog Badgers are omnivores and they feed on a variety of things
              from honey and fruit to insects and small mammals.
            </p>
            <p>
              A young / baby of a hog badger is called a 'kit'. The females are
              called 'sow' and males 'boar'. A hog badger group is called a
              'cete, colony, set or company'.
