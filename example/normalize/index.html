      <h1>My Webpage, Without Styling</h1>
      <p>
        I've created this webpage to demonstrate what complicated HTML looks
        like without styling.

      <h1>Differences Section</h1>
      <p>
        There are some major differences between the user agent stylesheets of
        different browsers, such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How much margin there is on the body</li>
        <li>How large the font of an h1 is inside a section</li>
        <li>
          Borders and text-decoration of an
          <abbr title="Abbreviation">abbr</abbr> element
        </li>
        <li>The size of <small>small</small> text</li>
        <li>
          How <sup>sup</sup> and <sub>sub</sub> elements affect the line-height
        </li>
        <li>
          The padding inside a
          <input type="search" placeholder="search box" /> on Chrome on macOS
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        <h1>User-defined differences</h1>
        <p>
          As well as the differences between browsers, users can set their
          preference for the default font-size and default font-family of
          webpages.
        </p>
        <p>We can always override these ourselves with our own CSS.</p>
