TThis looks great Jescel!
You have used flexbox brilliantly and is already resizing very well, my only advice is regarding images.

For the logo and icons on the locals love and local complain about I would assign them a width as this will help you for them to conserve proportions when making a website responsive.

Let me know if you have any questions!!
