 * creating variables
 *
 * TASK:
 * Create a variable called myVar and give it the value "amazing"

 * PRACTICE 5
 * working with functions
 *
 * TASK:
 * Create a function that logs a greeting to the console
 * Your function should accept one parameter for a persons name
 * Your function should log to the console and display a greeting message and the name
 * Call your function and pass in a persons name and check the console

/***************
 * PRACTICE 6
 * working with the DOM - single elements
 *

 * use getElementById to find the h1 element on the page
 * use JS to add the class "fancy" to the element
 * use JS to change the innerText of the h1 to something other than "Javascript Practice"
 */

 getElementById
/***************
 * PRACTICE 7
 * working with the DOM - multiple elements
 *
 * TASK:
 * use querySelectorAll to find the p elements on the page
 * use JS to add the class "fancy" to EACH element (you will need a loop!)

/***************
 * PRACTICE 8
 * working with the DOM - events
 *
 * TASK:
 * create a function called sendHelp
 * add the following line to the body of the function: window.location.href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference';
 * use getElementById or querySelector to find the help button
 * add a 'click' event listener to the button and pass the name of your sendHelp function
 * click the button and you should be redirected to another website
 */

/***************
 * PRACTICE 9
 * working with the DOM - multipe elements and events
 *
 * TASK:
 * toggle the "fancy" class on any paragraph when you click on it
 *
 * TIPS:
 * Think of the 3 E's - element, event, execution
 * Think about how you will find all the p tags (which document method can you use)
 * Think about how you will add the event listener to each one of the p tags
 * Think about passing the event object into your handler function
 * Use event.target inside your handler function for a reference to the element that was clicked
