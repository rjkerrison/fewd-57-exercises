# Task

Your grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you below in this `.md` document – thank you, grandma!

She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. Hint: you need an _ordered list_.

For extra recipe authenticity, add an anecdote about how these cookies bring you back to simpler times.
