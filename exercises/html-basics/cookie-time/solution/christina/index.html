    <h1>The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>My absolute favorite! These always made me feel incredibly happy when I'd go visit grandma. My sister and I loved helping her, but mostly, we just ate the cookie dough. :-p </p>

    <p>As always with baking, try to be as precise as possible. Both with measuring, as well as the order in which you take the steps by. </p> 
    
    <p>Now get ready for some chocolately goodness. </p>
