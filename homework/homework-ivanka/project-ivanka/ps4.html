              Cyberpunk 2077 is played in a first-person perspective as V, a
              mercenary whose voice, face, hairstyles, body type and
              modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. Stat
              categories—Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are
              influenced by the character classes that players assume, which are
              NetRunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat).

              by classic dungeon crawlers and set in the Minecraft universe! Up
