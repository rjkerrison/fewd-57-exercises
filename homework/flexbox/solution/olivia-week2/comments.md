This looks all looks great Olivia! Well done!
The html and css is very well organize, I only have one recommendation regarding css organization. Best practice is to put all properties regarding display all together for instance for the element below css should be organized like this:

li.location {

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-basis: 250px;
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
  
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 24px;
    color: white;

    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
  
}


I'll be sending you an image regarding css organization on slack to complement this :)

Well done again!
