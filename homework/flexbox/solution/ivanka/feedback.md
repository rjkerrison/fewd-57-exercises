# Homework Feedback

Hi Ivanka!

Great work on this homework.
The styling was very good, the site looked just like the screenshot.

Your biggest room for improvement is in your HTML.
These are the big points to remember:

- Not everything needs a class
- You can reuse classes!
- Use more semantic HTML. Sometimes there's a better option than a `<div>`,
and make use of `ul` and `li` when something is a list. Also, `<nav>` is for a group of links, not for one individual link.

I've added comments and made some changes in your HTML and your CSS,
so have a read of those.
