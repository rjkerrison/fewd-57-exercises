# Homework Feedback

Hey Vladimir!

Great homework here, the HTML structure is excellent.
The only thing that might be missing is `<a>` tags for the city names or the call-to-action buttons,
but if this were a real site they'd be easy to add later when we know what the `href`s would be.

Your CSS is well-structured.
I like the use of `.multiple.classnames` and your `li.location` selectors for targeting the list items.

I've added some additional CSS in `./style/additional.css` which tidies up the design.
The biggest change is the `display: flex` and related properties I've added to the sections
in order to centre everything.
