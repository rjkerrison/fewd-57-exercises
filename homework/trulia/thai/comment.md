This looks really good and i think is really good that you cna exit the model in 2 ways!

If you can to work on this exercise a bit more address responsive elements to the navigation bars, we will be looking soon at burger menu with javascript so it could be a fantastic that for the mobile version of this all the option appear when clicking Trulia icon. For the footer maybe just adding wrap property in the flex container?

I would definitely add this exercise to your github when you finish it! Well done again.
