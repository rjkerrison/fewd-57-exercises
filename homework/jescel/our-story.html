                            Having spent almost ten years in hospitality particularly in food and beverage, I have always wanted to do something creative in my spare time. Instead of telling you who I am, I will start by telling you what I am not - I am not a professional leatherworker. I did not have any professional background in leather products or fashion design.<br>
                            I am a self-taught individual with a passion to create wonderful items that are useful and pleasing to the eye. My journey started by using my spare time to learn, create and work with my hands towards the goal of creating something I am passionate about. The work started in our kitchen counter and after many nights of research and tutorials, the day finally came to share the fruit of my labour. It was a lot of trial and error and hard work. At the same, it is rewarding to create something great.<br> 
                            It all began with an idea and here we are now, sharing what I’ve worked on for the last several months. As the saying goes “It always seems impossible until it's done.”<br>
                            Enjoy!<br>

                    <p> 
                        Welcome to CELARIS LONDON, thank you for visiting our site. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of handmade products, with a focus on quality, simplicity, utility and
                        pleasing the eye.<br>
                        Founded in 2020 during the pandemic, our online store was created from humble beginnings that started as a hobby on our kitchen counter in our flat in England. When we first started out, our passion for creating products drove us to action:  do tons of research, find the supplier for leather and tools, choose the colours, the texture and the small details such as thread and press buttons studs. And CELARIS London was born!  We now serve customers all over the country with plans to extend internationally and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into a business through our own website.<br>
                        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br>
                        Sincerely,<br>
                        Jescel & Aris

                We are dedicated to produce the highest quality of handcrafted leather goods as possible. All of our goods are crafted by one craftsman and we use ethically sourced materials.<br> 
                <br>
                Please note that as leather is a natural material and each one of our products is completely handmade, colours and markings may vary from item to item. Each leather hide accepts dye differently so shade may vary slightly. The leather will transform with time, touch and sunlight to a rich dark tan.</p>
