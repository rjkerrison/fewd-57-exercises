Congrats on your first homework Olivia!
Well done!, the css and html look pretty good.
On the html file comments are mainly about extra blank spaces on the file, there was some styling on the html file that should be on the css file as that is best practice. 
On the css file I found some lines of code that where not really styling the final output, it's best to remove these lines. 
Overall it looks really good and only minor changes and improvements :)
