Congrats on your first homework!
I looks really good, html and css is very well organized and final product is great!
On the html file I mainly left a comment regarding the picture tag that you used, I think this tag is great for responsive design but for this exercise using a div would be best. 
Regarding the css, nothing much to add rather than I think there are some lines of code that should be remove as they are not really affecting the front-end.
Well done! see you later on class :)
