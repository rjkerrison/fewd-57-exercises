# Homework One Feedback

Hi Ivanka!

I've added feedback in your code as comments,
so do have a look at the files again.

It's a great first homework. I didn't see any major problems with HTML or CSS, all of it was well-formatted and readable.
I like the design, too, and the use of margin and padding to create space is good.
