Sipo the homework looks great! very minor amends.

On your html file: I notice that you wrapped the a tag with a div but in this case this is not really needed so you cna remove it and allocate the class name of the div to the a tag. 

On the css you have repeated a couple of times "font-family" property but the font remains the same as the one assigned on html therefore there's not need for it to be repeated as the child parent relationship will carry it over across the file. 

Let me know if yu have any questions :)
