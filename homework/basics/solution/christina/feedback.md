# Homework Feedback

Great first homework here. I like the design.

Nice to see that you've got a handle on transparency in colours for your backgrounds.

I notice a lot of your CSS is taken from `../solution/robin`, which is totally fine.

Your HTML is looking neat, it's just the indentation which could improve things there.

## CSS Selectors

You've avoided repeating yourself in your CSS, which is great.
Declaration blocks like

```css
main,
h1,
h2,
section {
  border-radius: 2rem;
}
```

really help to clarify shared properties.

As a developer, I know from looking at this
to expect identical rounded corners on many elements.
It makes it easier to adjust all of the border radiuses
